## About
### Problem Statement
Theme 2: Towards a highly connected Port+ Ecosystem

Demand-supply management in the container logistics ecosystem is a critical aspect of ensuring efficient operations. Firstly, it involves forecasting demand for container shipments, taking into account various factors such as seasonal fluctuations and market trends. Secondly, supply management entails optimizing the availability of containers, ensuring that there are enough containers to meet the demand at key locations and times. Thirdly, it involves capacity management for container ships and terminals, making sure that the infrastructure can handle the expected volume of shipments. Effective demand-supply management helps prevent congestion at ports, reduces shipping delays, and lowers operational costs. This balance between supply and demand is essential for maintaining the fluidity and reliability of container logistics.

### Architecture
Logiflow utilizes a client-server architecture with ReactJS for the frontend and Flask for the backend. Data analysis and AI-driven predictions are integrated to optimize demand and supply. 

## Features
Sure, here's an elaboration of your three core features using Markdown:

### 1. AI-Driven Predictive Analytics
Logiflow leverages cutting-edge AI algorithms to provide predictive analytics for key port metrics. It analyzes historical data, taking into account factors such as seasonality, market trends, and historical vessel arrivals, cargo, and container throughput. By harnessing the power of AI, Logiflow accurately predicts future months' data, allowing port operators and logistics professionals to make informed decisions. This feature ensures that container logistics operations are well-prepared for fluctuations in demand and can optimize resource allocation accordingly.

### 2. Interactive Dashboard
Logiflow offers an intuitive and interactive dashboard that empowers users with real-time insights into critical port metrics. The dashboard displays historical and predicted data for vessel arrivals, total cargo, container throughput, and cargo breakdown. Users can easily navigate through the dashboard to access detailed information, enabling them to make data-driven decisions efficiently. With this feature, port operators can monitor the current state of their operations, compare it with historical data, and plan for the future with confidence.

### 3. Simulated Reports
Logiflow goes beyond data analysis by providing a unique simulated reports feature. Users can experiment with different operational cost scenarios and observe the direct impact on container throughput. This functionality allows logistics professionals to fine-tune their strategies, optimize resource allocation, and reduce operational costs while maintaining the desired level of container throughput. Simulated reports provide valuable insights into cost-effectiveness, ensuring that port operations are both efficient and financially sustainable.

## Roadmap
Logiflow's future roadmap includes further enhancements in demand forecasting, advanced AI integration, and scalability to accommodate the growing needs of PSA and the entire supply chain ecosystem. We are committed to ensuring the seamless flow of cargo and reducing operational complexities in container logistics.
